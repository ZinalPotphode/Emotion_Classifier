## Introduction

This project implements an image classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions in images, specifically classifying them as "happy" or "sad." The model was trained to achieve a 96% accuracy in emotion detection, making it a reliable tool for emotion recognition tasks.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN model for emotion detection.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 96% accuracy in classifying images as happy or sad.
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Can be integrated into applications for real-time emotion recognition.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
